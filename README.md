The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 
The overall variance (76.23), as well as variances for Lot 1 (1.15) and Lot 2 (10.13) are below this criteria. However, variance for Lot 3 was above this threshold (220.01).

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.
Consumers may want to dive deeper into information related to miles per gallon (mpg) when selecting a vehicle, especially as gas prices rise. To test for this, I would recommend utilizing the t-test. One sample t-tests can be conducted between MechaCar's overall mpg against the general market average mpg, as well as between the competator's overall mpg against the geenral market average mpg. One sample t-tests are specifically designed to provide measures comparing the average of a sample against the overall population. The null hypothesis would be that if there is no difference between the average mpg of the MechaCar and the general mpg average for all cars, nor for the competator's average mpg versus the MechaCar. Data on the mpg for MechaCar, the competator, and the current overall mpg in all vehicles would be required to complete this analysis.
